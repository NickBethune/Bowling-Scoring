# Bowling-Scoring
*Bowling Scoring app for the Google Android Basics Nanodegree*

The assignment for Project 2 of the Google Android Basics Nanodegree was to create a scorekeeping app for a sport of our choice,
with a number of requirements such as including two players, and tracking multiple scores. Since I wanted a challenge, I decided
to focus on a sport that's more difficult to keep score for. Initially, I settled on Snooker, due to its somewhat complex scoring
system, but eventually gave up on that due to my lack of passion for the sport and seemingly difficult structure of the game.

As such, I picked a sport I actually like, which has complicated scoring that I hadn't previously understood, and set out to create
an app to track its score. The sport is, obviously, bowling, and I started with a rough paper sketch and some features I wanted to
include, as well as some code scribbled on paper as well regarding the functionality of scoring a game that calculates score based
on future moves, without simply hardcoding all the possibilities. 

From there, I moved on to mocking up the app, then printing it out and figuring how to lay everything out in XML. This is pretty much
where the project is currently, and it looks 90% how I intended it to. 

**To do:**
- write Java to automate selection of # of pins
- write Java to automate moving cursor to active player
- write Java to automate game logic and scoring
- write Java to convert scores to symbols (10 -> X, spare -> /, 0 -> -)
- improve XML layout to use widths
- (optional) create a landscape layout
- (optional) improve UI for selection of # of pins
